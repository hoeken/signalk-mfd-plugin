# SignalK plugin to add WebApp tiles to a B&G/Navico MFD

This plugin allows you to add WebApps to your MFD. Possible use cases are:
 - [NavTex messages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/signalk-navtex-plugin)
 - [SailTrim](https://www.npmjs.com/package/signalk-trim-plugin)

## HTML5
There's quite some restriction on what works. It needs to be quite strict HTML5. Keyboard interaction (keys) doesn't work.

## Ethernet required
WebApps will only appear on the MFD when it's connected through wired Ethernet.
